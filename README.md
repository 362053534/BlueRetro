Lost or broken controllers? Reproduction too expensive? Need those rare and obscure accessories? Just use the Bluetooth devices you already got! The project is open source hardware & software. It's built for the popular ESP32 chip. All processing for Bluetooth and HID input decoding is done on a single core which makes it easy for other projects to use the Bluetooth stack within their own project as long the application is running on the other core. Wii, Switch, PS3, PS4, Xbox One & generic HID Bluetooth devices are supported. Saturn, N64, GameCube & Dreamcast are supported with simultaneous 4+ players using a single adapter.
