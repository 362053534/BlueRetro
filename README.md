Lost or broken controllers? Need those rare and obscure accessories? Just use the Bluetooth devices you already got! The project is open source hardware & software. It's built for the popular ESP32 chip. All processing for Bluetooth and HID input decoding is done on a single core which makes it easy for other projects to use the Bluetooth stack within their own project as long the application is running on the other core. It's a spiritual successor in some way to my https://github.com/darthcloud/cube64-dx project fork. This is my wildcard entry to the #2020HACKADAYPRIZE
